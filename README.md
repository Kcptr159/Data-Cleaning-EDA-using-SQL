# Using SQL Data cleaning and EDA analysis

In this project, our analysis revolves around a dataset sourced from 'Real World Fake Data,' which we scrutinize using SQL before proceeding to visualize it using Tableau.

The provided dataset link is: https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

It's worth noting that 'Real World Fake Data' offers a splendid collection of datasets, allowing the freedom to select from a range of options. For this project, I opted to work with the call center dataset.

The key project steps encompass:

Acquiring the CSV file.
Importing the file into MySQL.
Conducting slight data cleaning, although the initial dataset is already quite tidy.
Engaging in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) activities.
